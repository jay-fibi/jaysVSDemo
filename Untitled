"""
This module demonstrates various uses of for loops in Python.

It includes examples of:
- Printing numbers from 1 to 10
- Iterating over characters in a string
- Using 'continue' to skip an iteration
- Using 'break' to exit a loop early
- Printing numbers from 1 to 1000

Note: The last example (printing 1 to 1000) is indented incorrectly
and will not run as part of the module's main execution.
