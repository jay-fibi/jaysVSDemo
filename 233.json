The `int()` function is used to convert the user\u0027s input (which is a string by default) to an integer.\n\n```python\nsum \u003d 0\nfor i in range(num):\n    number \u003d float(input(\"Enter number: \"))\n    sum \u003d sum + number\n```\n\nHere, we initialize a variable `sum` to 0. Then, we use a `for` loop to iterate `num` times (based on the user\u0027s input). In each iteration, we prompt the user to enter a number using `float(input(\"Enter number: \"))`. This number is then added to the `sum` variable.\n\n```python\nprint(\"The sum is:\", sum)\n```\n\nAfter the loop finishes, we print the final sum using the `print` statement.\n\n```python\n#print \"hello world\"\nprint(f\"The sum of entered numbers is: {sum}\")\n```\n\nThis line is a commented out print statement, and the next line prints the sum again using an f-string (formatted string literal).\n\n```python\ndef mergeSort(arr):\n    if len(arr) \u003e 1:    mid \u003d len(arr) // 2\n    L \u003d arr[:mid]\n    R \u003d arr[mid:]\n\n    mergeSort(L)\n    mergeSort(R)\n\n    i \u003d j \u003d k \u003d 0\n\n    while i \u003c len(L) and j \u003c len(R):\n        if L[i] \u003c R[j]:\n            arr[k] \u003d L[i]\n            i +\u003d 1\n        else:\n            arr[k] \u003d R[j]\n            j +\u003d 1\n        k +\u003d 1\n\n    while i \u003c len(L):\n        arr[k] \u003d L[i]\n        i +\u003d 1\n        k +\u003d 1\n\n    while j \u003c len(R):\n        arr[k] \u003d R[j]\n        j +\u003d 1\n        k +\u003d 1\n```\n\nThis is a Python function named `mergeSort` that implements the merge sort algorithm for sorting a list or array. The function takes an array `arr` as input and recursively divides it into two halves until the base case of a single element is reached. Then, it merges the sorted halves back together in a sorted manner.\n\n```python\n#print the merged array\nprint(\"Good morning\")\n```\n\nThis line is a commented out print statement, and the next line simply prints the string \"Good morning\".\n\nOverall, this code prompts the user to enter multiple numbers, calculates their sum, and prints the result. It also includes a function for implementing the merge sort algorithm and a couple of print statements."}}]}}
